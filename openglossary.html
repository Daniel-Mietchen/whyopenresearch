<header><h3>Core definitions</h3></header>  
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;list-style-position:inside">
  <li>Open Access (OA) - making peer reviewed scholarly manuscripts
  freely available via the Internet, permitting any user to read,
  download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full text
  of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to
  software, or use them for any lawful purpose, without financial,
  legal or technical barriers other than those inseparable from
  gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on
  reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in
  this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of
  their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited. May
  also refer to theses, books, book chapters, monographs and other
  content. (BOAI)</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Open Data - making data freely available on the public internet
  permitting any user to download, copy, analyse, re-process, pass
  them to software or use them for any other purpose without
  financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable
  from gaining access to the internet itself. (Panton Principles)</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Open Educational Resources (OER) - high quality, openly
  licensed, online educational materials for sharing, use, and
  reuse. They act as a mechanism for instructional innovation as
  networks of teachers and learners share best
  practices. (Source)</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Open Source Software (OSS) - availability of source code for a
  piece of software, along with an open source license permitting
  reuse, adaptation, and further distribution. (Wikipedia)</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Article Processing Charge (APC) - a fee charged to the author,
  creator, or institution to cover the cost of an article, rather than
  charging the potential reader of the article. APCs may apply to both
  commercial and Open Access publications. APCs are sometimes charged
  to authors in order to cover the cost of publishing and
  disseminating an article in an Open Access scholarly
  journal. (Source)</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Repository (article) - an archive to deposit manuscripts. These
  can be personal, institutional, on websites such as ResearchGate or
  Academia.edu, or subject-based such as arXiv.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Repository (software) - a collection of files managed with
  version control software (e.g., bzr, hg, git, csv, svn, etc.). Can
  be hosted by third-party (e.g., github, bitbucket, sourceforge), by
  an institution, or self-hosted locally.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Institutional Repository - An online database designed to
  collect the intellectual output of a particular institution or
  university, including digital collections such as electronic theses
  and dissertations (ETDs), pre-prints, or faculty scholarship, and
  presents associated metadata regarding the these items. (Source)</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Embargo period - a length of time imposed on a research output
  for users who have not paid for access, or do not have institutional
  access, before it is made freely available.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Reproducibility - the similarity between results of a study or
  experiment and independent results obtained with the same methods
  but under different conditions (i.e., pertains to results).</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Repeatability - the similarity between results of a study or
  experiment and independent results obtained with the same methods
  and under identical conditions (i.e., pertains to methods and
  analysis).</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Publishing - to make a research output available to the
  public. Commonly refers to the release of works by publishers,
  irrespective of whether public access is granted or not.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Sharing - the joint use of a resource or space. A fundamental
  aspect of collaborative research. As most research is
  digitally-authored & digitally-published, the resulting digital
  content is non-rivalrous and can be shared without any loss to the
  original creator.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Paywall - restriction via a financial barrier to research, often
  implemented by legacy publishers. Can be removed by personal or
  institutional subscription. See Loginwall for a barrier that
  prevents access, without asking for money to unlock access.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Funder - an institute, corporation or government body that
  provides financial assistance for research.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Publisher - a company whose purpose is to make the outputs of
  research publicly available.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Creative work - An original, identifiable piece of content, such
  as an academic paper, a diagram, a photograph, or a video
  clip. Owners of creative works have rights, such as copyright, that
  they might reserve to keep control of the content, or relinquish to
  allow others to share and reuse that content.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Intellectual property (IP) - a legal term that refers to
  creations of the mind. Examples of intellectual property include
  music, literature, and other artistic works; discoveries and
  inventions; and phrases, symbols, and designs.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) - the rights given to the
  owners of intellectual property. IPR is protected either
  automatically (eg copyright, design rights) or by registering or
  applying for it (eg trademarks, patents). Protecting your
  intellectual property makes it easier to take legal action against
  anyone who steals or copies it. IPR can be legally sold, assigned or
  licenced by the creator to other parties, or joint-owned.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Copyright - The aspect of Intellectual property that gives
  creators the right to permit (or not permit) what happens to their
  creations, as opposed to trademark rights or moral rights.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Copyleft - a form of licensing that makes a creative work freely
  available to be modified, and requiring all modified and extended
  versions of the creative work to be free as well. Open Access does
  not require works to be copyleft, nor does it necessarily exclude
  copyleft works from being open access. The recommended licence
  (CC-BY) for academic publishing is not copyleft.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Subscription - a form of business model whereby a fee is paid in
  order to gain access to a product or service - in this case, the
  outputs of scholarly research.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Toll access - whereby a fee is required to pass a paywall to
  access research.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Legacy publisher - a publisher that historically has operated on
  a paywall-based business model.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Open access publisher - a publisher that publishes all research
  articles as open access articles. Most legacy publishers have
  options to make journals at least partially open access.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Open access journal - a journal that exclusively comprises open
  access articles.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Impact - the scale of use of research outputs both inside and
  outside of academia.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Self-archiving - making a copy of a manuscript available through
  a personal website, institutional repository, or other
  repository.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>Scholarly Communication - The creation, transformation,
  dissemination, and preservation of knowledge related to teaching,
  research, and scholarly endeavors; the process of academics,
  scholars and researchers sharing and publishing their research
  findings so that they are available to the wider academic
  community. The creation, transformation, dissemination, and
  preservation of knowledge related to teaching, research, and
  scholarly endeavors; the process of academics, scholars and
  researchers sharing and publishing their research findings so that
  they are available to the wider academic community. (Sources:
